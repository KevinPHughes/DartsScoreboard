# Darts electronic scoreboard

I have a dart board and I made a scoreboard page I can pull up on my iPad.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
It's now running at port 3000 (Or whatever is set to environment variable PORT)

# Development: 
Run this command for continuous coffee and less compiling:

```sh
$ gulp
```
